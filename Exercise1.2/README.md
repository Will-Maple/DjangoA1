# DjangoA1 (exercise 1.2)

This exercise was a bit of silliness, asking for deliverables for the optional exercises that only matter if they are being checked (like screenshots) and asking for a structure "that contains the following keys" which has to be a dictionary because only they have keys and then asking me to write that in "your README file in the repository for this task" when the last exercise asked me to make a respository containing all the exercises for this achievement. Anyway, the correct answer is that recipe_1 will be a dictionary so that it can have keys with each type of data match with them, then when there are presumably multiple recipes you can just remember the keys which will be repeated thru each of them to get the individualized data that you actually want.

all_recipes has to be a list type for the recipes to be able to modifiable (at least in a direct way).
